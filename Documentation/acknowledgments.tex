Many thanks to my family: my two brothers, my mother and father, and my sister.
Thank you for your eternal and unwavering support throughout my life, both in the good and the bad.

Thank you to plante (\url{https://github.com/plante3}{github}) for the guidance and mentoring in the way of \TeX.
Many of the macros in this project are due to, or inspired by, him.

Thank you to the Mathematics Discord server (\url{https://discord.com/invite/math}{invite}) for fostering a welcoming community where anyone can learn math, and for first introducing me to the world of \TeX.

Thank you to all my friends for their continued support and interest.

Thank you to my dogs, past and present.
I adore you both, and will forever.
