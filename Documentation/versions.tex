\subsection{pdfToolbox v0.2} \anchor{v0.2}

Bug fixes and added features.

\subsubsection{What's New?}

\blist
    \item Fixed bug caused \macro\url{} to create malformed PDF files.
    \item Added listings.
    \item Changed the method of creating section headers, and their corresponding toc line (see \gotoanchor{table-of-contents}), more work is now done by \gotomacro\settocdepthformat{} and \gotomacro\addtoccontent.
        (This is also a breaking change.)
\elist

\subsubsection{What's Broken}

\pdftoolbox{} v0.2 adds breaking changes to the toolbox.
These changes will render files created with previous versions un-compilable.
\blist
    \item \macro\linkborder{} no longer wraps its ouput in \inlinecode|attr {...}|, which is necessary for anchors;
        now \macro\_gotoanchor{} adds this wrapping.
    \item \macro\_splitcontentbox{} now requires more arguments which allows for more customization (for more information, see \gotomacro\_splitcontentbox).
    \item Changed the method of creating section headers, and their corresponding toc line (see the section on \gotoanchor{table-of-contents}{tables of content}),
        more work is now done by \gotomacro\settocdepthformat{} and \gotomacro\addtoccontent.
